## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap v5.1](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### What I learned

Learnt how to use bootstrap combined with CSS, making it easier to deal with some lines of codes. It was a huge challenge for me, especially the pricing area where I had to figure out how to put all the elements together and I had no idea how. But I did it (took me 2 days but hey, I DID IT! :D)

### Continued development

- There's a lot of room for improvement using bootstrap and taking advantage of it in any way possible;
- Make my code more readable and more flexible, reusing as much as possible without making it super complicated to read;
- *Mentality Improvement*: don't be so stubborn, Google is my friend and I should take advantage of it - although it is really rewarding figuring out on your own but definitely should check it when you take too much time trying to find a way to do x or z.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - It's always a good to find what you could do or definitely, not do!
- [Shay Howe](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/positioning-content/) - Saved me when I was stuck with the pricing part with the positioning, even though I saw it before I was trying to do it with rows and cols but it was so much easier and I felt silly after I read the page. And if he ever sees this, awesome content btw!
- [Coding Yaar](https://codingyaar.com/bootstrap-profile-card-1/) - I was using the bootstrap for the shadow but as my card radius was bigger than the shadow radius by Bootstrap and it had a small border showing around the corner and I didn't that (it looked bad, even though you barely could see it, it was looking bad!') I found this website where it helped me use the right radius for my shadow. Thank you!
- [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPJVi797Uy0) - Helped me understand SVG and gave me a huge website tip to use to design your own curves. Also the best!
- [Shape Divider](https://www.shapedivider.app/) - website to create your own svg, absolutely awesome!
